* Analize the stations information.
  * List of stations with data points.
  * Information about the most active station.
  * Plot histogram with data from the most active station.
* Vacation exploration.
  * Generate function to retrive min, max and average temperatures from vacation start and end dates.
  * Plot results
  * Generate table with station information from last year vacation dates.
  * Calculate the daily normals of the trip with min, mean, and max temperature.
  * Plot results
* Create an API endpoint to call some of the previous queries.
